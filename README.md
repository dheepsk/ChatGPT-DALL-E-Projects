# ChatGPT-DALL-E-Templates

I created Chat-GPT and DALL-E prompt templates to integrate into various frameworks, like Microsoft Power Apps, Bubble, Outlook, and more! 

I used Virtual Studio Code and Microsoft Azure to implement these functions. The "completionapi" branch refers to the files related to the Chat-GPT aspects and the "imageai" branch refers to the DALL-E image aspects, both under the branch, "basicazurefunction".
